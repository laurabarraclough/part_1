# part_1- Analysis
Analysis of model runs from part_1 of Stubai iLand modelling project.

Looking to combine the datasets from the different model runs using year as the index key and then use some analysis to:
* look at the differences between model runs- are they siginifcantly different and where do they vary?
* look at some of the statistics from the two time points of interest: 2050 and 2100
* see if I can convert some of the outputs into ecosystem service supply
